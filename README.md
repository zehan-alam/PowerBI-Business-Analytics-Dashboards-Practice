# Power BI Internship Projects

During my internship, I explored and mastered the fundamentals of Power BI, focusing on designing insightful dashboards and presenting data-driven insights effectively. Over the first three weeks, I worked on guided, unguided, and team projects, culminating in a presentation of my findings. Below is an overview of the projects I worked on and the skills I gained during this journey.

## Key Skills Acquired:
- Mastered Power BI basics: visuals, Power Query, and DAX for custom calculations.
- Transformed raw data into actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making.
- Gained expertise in data modeling: normalization, reducing redundancy, relationships, cardinality, and more.
